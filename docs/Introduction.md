## What's Linux ?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux):
> Linux or GNU/Linux is a free and open source software Unix-like operating
> system for computers.
> An operating system is a collection of the basic
> instructions that manage the electronic parts of the computer allowing
> running application programs. Linux is Free and open source software (FOSS).
> Free and open source software (FOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to
> use it, see how it works, change it or share it.
> There is a lot of software for Linux and—like Linux itself—a lot of the
> software for Linux is free software. This means that it doesn't put any
> license restrictions on users. This is one reason why many people like
> to use Linux.

From [linux.com](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux):

Just like Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Mac OS X, Linux is an
operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the
hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply –
the operating system manages the communication between your software and your
hardware. Without the operating system (often referred to as the “OS”),
the software wouldn’t function.

The OS is comprised of a number of pieces: 

- **The Bootloader**

The software that manages the boot process of your computer.
For most users, this will simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually
goes away to boot into the operating system.

- **The Kernel**

This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called
“Linux”. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and
peripheral devices. The kernel is the “lowest” level of the OS.

- **Daemons**

These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc)
that either start up during boot, or after you log into the desktop.

- **The Shell**

You’ve probably heard mention of the Linux command line. This is
the shell – a command process that allows you to control the computer via
commands typed into a text interface. This is what, at one time, scared people
away from Linux the most (assuming they had to learn a seemingly archaic
command line structure to make Linux work). This is no longer the case. With
modern desktop Linux, there is no need to ever touch the command line.

- **Graphical Server**

This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your
monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just “X”.

- **Desktop Environment**

This is the piece of the puzzle that the users actually
interact with. There are many desktop environments to choose from (Unity,
GNOME, Cinnamon, Enlightenment, KDE, XFCE, etc). Each desktop environment
includes built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web
browsers, games, etc).

- **Applications**

 Desktop environments do not offer the full array of apps. Just
like Windows and Mac, Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality
software titles that can be easily found and installed. Most modern Linux
distributions (more on this in a moment) include App Store-like tools that
centralize and simplify application installation.

## Why use Linux ?

This is the one question that most people ask. Why bother learning a completely
different computing environment, when the operating system that ships with most
desktops, laptops, and servers works just fine? To answer that question, I
would pose another question. Does that operating system you’re currently using
really work “just fine”? Or are you constantly battling viruses, malware, slow
downs, crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees?

If you struggle with the above, and want to free yourself from the constant
fear of losing data or having to take your computer in for the “yearly clean
up,” Linux might be the perfect platform for you. Linux has evolved into one of
the most reliable computer ecosystems on the planet. Combine that reliability
with zero cost of entry and you have the perfect solution for a desktop
platform.

That’s right, zero cost of entry...as in free. You can install Linux on as many
computers as you like without paying a cent for software or server licensing
(including costly Microsoft Client Access License – CALs).

Let’s take a look at the cost of a Linux server, in comparison to Windows
Server 2012. The price of the Windows Server 2012 software alone can run up to
$1,200.00 USD. That doesn’t include CALs, and licenses for other software you
may need to run (such as a database, a web server, mail server, etc). With the
Linux server...it’s all free and easy to install. In fact, installing a full
blown web server (that includes a database server), is just a few clicks or
commands away (take a look at “Easy LAMP Server Installation” to get an idea
how simple it can be).

If you’re a system administrator, working with Linux is a dream come true. No
more daily babysitting servers. In fact, Linux is as close to “set it and
forget it” as you will ever find. And, on the off chance, one service on the
server requires restarting, re-configuring, upgrading, etc...most likely the
rest of the server won’t be affected.

Be it the desktop or a server, if zero cost isn’t enough to win you over – what
about having an operating system that will work, trouble free, for as long as
you use it? I’ve personally used Linux for nearly twenty years (as a desktop
and server platform) and have not once had an issue with malware, viruses, or
random computer slow-downs. It’s that stable. And server reboots? Only if the
kernel is updated. It is not out of the ordinary for a Linux server to go years
without being rebooted. That’s stability and dependability.

Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source follows the
following key philosophies:

- The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do
what you wish.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

The above are crucial to understanding the community that comes together to
create the Linux platform. It is, without a doubt, an operating system that is
“by the people, for the people”. These philosophies are also one of the main
reasons a large percentage of people use Linux. It’s about freedom and freedom
of choice.

## What is a Linux "distribution" ?

Linux has a number of different versions to suit nearly any type of user. From
new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a “flavor” of Linux to match your
needs. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form,
“distros.”) Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free,
burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as
you like).

## What is Morphux ?
Morphux is a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distribution,
aimed to be light, efficient, and portable.
