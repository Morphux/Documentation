# Morphux Package Manager

## What is a Package Manager
A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your computer,
and allows you to easily install new software, upgrade software to newer
versions, or remove software that you previously installed. As the name
suggests, package managers deal with packages: collections of files that are
bundled together and can be installed and removed as a group.

##Â MPM
Mpm is the morphux package manager. If you're familiar with other package
managers like apt, pkg, etc. it's about the same.

## Install a Package
Open a terminal, and type:
```
sudo mpm install pkg/name
```
Let's deconstruct this command:

- ```sudo```: Give the root power to this command (Required for installing a
program)
- ```mpm```: Mpm binary
- ```install```: Install command
- ```pkg/```: Category of the package
- ```name```: Name of the package
